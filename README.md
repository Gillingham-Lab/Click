# Click

Click is a collection of pre-made and tested reaction patterns to use with RDKit molecules.
The reactions can be used to sequentially modify a molecule, or to create combinatorial 
libraries. Click is only doing the reaction as you've specified and does *not* check 
if the reaction would work.
