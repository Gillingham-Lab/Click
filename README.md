# Click

Click is a collection of pre-made and tested reaction patterns to use with RDKit molecules.
The reactions can be used to sequentially modify a molecule, or to create combinatorial 
libraries. Click is only doing the reaction as you've specified and does *not* check 
if the reaction would work.

## Requirements

* RDKit (version >= 2019.03)
* Python (version >= 3.6)

## Installation
To install Click, run

`pip install ClickReaction`
